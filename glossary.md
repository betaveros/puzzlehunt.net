# Overarching Terms

Australian-style puzzlehunt

:   Loosely describes a set of puzzlehunt operating conventions in which puzzles and pre-written hints are released at fixed times each day over several days. Named after the triad of Australian puzzlehunts MUMS, SUMS, and CiSRA, which ran with peak reliability around 2010–2013.

Capstone puzzle

:   A puzzle with particular significance in terms of hunt progression or unlocking, like a metapuzzle, but that doesn't directly use the answers of any feeder puzzles.

Feeder

:   A puzzle whose answer is used in a metapuzzle. Used to contrast with a metapuzzle or discuss puzzlehunts in which the matchup of feeders to metapuzzles is not provided or needs to be discovered somehow.

Flavor text

:   Text in a puzzle that's typically displayed right after the title and distinguished from the rest of the puzzle. Flavor text usually does not contain clues or puzzle components that are mechanically necessary for solving the puzzle (no letters will be extracted from them, for example), but may obliquely hint at a puzzle mechanism or be used as a component of the meta. Flavor text may also simply be irrelevant text that integrates the puzzle into a story (to provide “flavor”). (This is unlike the usage in, say, tabletop games, where typical flavor text is entirely mechanically irrelevant.) Not all puzzles have flavor text.

    An example is the italicized paragraph starting "Somebody's been sending Dippy pictures..." in [Oodles of Doodles](https://dp.puzzlehunt.net/puzzle/oodles-of-doodles.html).

Metapuzzle

:   A puzzle that uses answers from other puzzles. Typically unlocked after regular puzzles. Usually important for progressing through a hunt; the answer to a metapuzzle may have plot significance in that regard and is also often humorous or punny. The opposite may be called a "regular puzzle" or a "feeder".

# Puzzle Types

Conundrum

:   (also Konundrum, Duck Konundrum) A puzzle consisting of a sequence of detailed instructions that the solver must faithfully follow or simulate to solve the puzzle. The instructions are often unrealistic but easy to simulate, e.g. involving animals or fictional beings making complex decisions. The genre-defining example is [The Duck Konundrum](https://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2000/set5/6/Puzzle.html) from MIT Mystery Hunt.

[Ditloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditloid)

:   A type of word puzzle in which a phrase has had most of its words abbreviated, typically with common words like prepositions and articles preserved and with numbers preserved but written out as digits instead. Solvers must deduce the original phrase. For example, "24 H in a D" solves to "24 Hours in a Day".

[Dropquote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropquote)

:   A type of word puzzle where a phrase, quotation, or other series of words has been concealed in a crossword-like grid reading left to right, top to bottom, and then the letters in each column have been removed and provided in sorted order at the top.

Flat

:   A genre of word puzzle that clues wordplay-related words through context, usually in a verse. Most well known for appearing in the National Puzzlers’ League’s publication, <i>The ENIGMA</i>.

Identify, Sort, Index, Solve (ISIS)

:   A loosely defined, common puzzle type consisting of those four steps in order: identifying some puzzle-provided objects or clues, sorting them in some order based on the identification, indexing by a provided number to produce a cluephrase, and using the cluephrase to solve the puzzle.

    Coined [by Foggy Brume in 2010](https://foggyb.livejournal.com/43107.html).

Mangled clues

:   (there isn't a consensus term; other phrases include "cluetations", "word transformers", "tortued clues") A puzzle type in which clues are typically given without spaces and where each word has been modified according to some orthographic rule, things like "change all As to Bs", "insert a Q after the second letter", "Caesar shift the last letter forward by four", or combinations thereof. Typically, the answer to the clue will then be modified by the same rule or its reverse.

Runaround

:   A puzzle that generally involves following instructions to move around a physical space (by running or otherwise), typically to gather information in a puzzly way.

Pure metapuzzle

:   A metapuzzle with no or minimal content (e.g. only flavortext) in and of itself; the metapuzzle consists of just the answers that feed into it. The opposite is a "shell metapuzzle".

Puzzle trail

:   (not common) A linear sequence of puzzles where each one leads to the next, often by changing a component of the URL to the answer due to the technical simplicity of implementing that. The Ur-example is notpr0n.

Shell metapuzzle

:   A metapuzzle with content (the "shell"). For example, the metapuzzle might have a crossword grid that you are supposed to put the puzzle answers, or something related, into. The opposite is a "pure metapuzzle".

# Mechanics

Anagram

:   To rearrange the letters in a word, phrase, or sequence of letters; or a word/phrase produced by doing so. Outside puzzlehunts, this term is mainly used for two words/phrases that have some punny or humorous relation to each other. "DORMITORY is an anagram of DIRTY ROOM."

Diagonalize

:   To take the Nth letter of the Nth item in a sequence: the first letter of the first, the second letter of the second, and so on. A moderately common extraction technique, more so when all items have the same number of letters.

Eigenletter

:   (not really a thing, but I would like it to be, so take that) A humorous term for the overlapping extraction of taking the (usually unique) letter that appears at the same index in two words/phrases, more common if both words/phrases have the same number of letters. From the puzzle <span style="background-color: black">This Anagram Does Not Exist</span> in the 20<span style="background-color: black">20 Teammate Hunt</span> (unfortunately naming the hunt spoils it).

Index

:   To take the Nth letter from a word or phrase, or more rarely the Nth word from a sentence or just any Nth term from a sequence, for some given N. When indexing to extract letters, spaces and punctuation are typically skipped in the count. A common step in extraction.

Transaddition

:   Adding a letter and then anagramming, or a word/phrase produced by such a process. "MEGAPLEX is a transaddition of EXAMPLE." Probably from the NPL flat type, but used more loosely.

Transdeletion

:   Removing a letter and then anagramming, or a word/phrase produced by such a process. "EXAMPLE is a transdeletion of MEGAPLEX." Probably from the NPL flat type, but used more loosely.

# Solving Terminology

Answerphrase

:   A phrase of the form, "THE ANSWER IS (answer)". A degenerate form of the cluephrase. Mentioned in David Wilson's [Introduction to Writing Good Puzzle Hunt Puzzles](https://web.mit.edu/dwilson/www/puzzles/puzzlewriting.html).

Backsolve

:   To solve a puzzle by guessing the answer using constraints on it from the metapuzzle. The opposite is "forward-solve".

    There is a spectrum of backsolving. In the extreme case you might ignore the puzzle entirely and guess the answer simply based on how it fits into the metapuzzle. In milder cases, you might have a constraint like you know a few letters or a theme from the puzzle and also a constraint from the metapuzzle, and combine the two to find the answer.

    Puzzle and meta authors will sometimes try to design metapuzzles to prevent backsolving or make it harder, since if you backsolve a puzzle you manage to circumvent seeing the puzzle itself, which somebody probably worked really hard on.

Cluephrase

:   A phrase that suggests the final answer, or more generally just the next step in a puzzle, usually extracted from earlier information in the puzzle.

Enumeration

:   A number or sequence of numbers describing how many letters there are in an answer or each word thereof, often written in parentheses and occasionally with additional annotations. The enumeration for "EXAMPLE" might be (7). In multi-word phrases and other answers with spaces in them, the spaces may be noted with commas (typical in cryptics) or left as spaces; for example, the enumeration for "ORANGE JUICE" might be (6,6) or (6 6). Other punctuation is typically left verbatim; the enumeration for "JACK-O'-LANTERN" might be (4-1'-7).

    NPL flats have [more specific rules for enumerations](https://enigma.puzzlers.org/guide/composing#enumeration); asterisks are prepended to enumerations for words that are "inherently" capitalized, while carets are prepended to enumerations for words that are capitalized due to their context, such as being part of a multi-word name, among other annotations. THE DRAGON OF WANTLEY might be enumerated (^3 ^6 ^2 \*7). These are not particularly common.

    Some puzzles also feature "word enumerations" (a term I just made up) that tell you how many words are in an answer, but not the number of letters; when they exist, they are usually only added to answers with more than one word, and may look like (2 wds.). This may be done in, for example, cryptics with gimmicks where some entries require modifications before entry into the grid, and providing the exact enumerations would give too much away about which entries are being modified.

Extraction

:   A step in a puzzle solution that condenses its information; often, but not necessarily, the final step. Typical example involves extracting one letter from each clue answer or subpuzzle and having the letters spell out the answer or a cluephrase.

Forward-solve
:   To solve a puzzle normally, by using the given information to obtain a final answer. The opposite is "backsolve". This may involve some amount of Wheel of Fortune.

McFly

:   (v.) To forward-solve a puzzle you previously backsolved, usually after the hunt for fun.

Random anagram

:   (also "randomgram" or "unclued anagram") Any anagramming step in a puzzle without a provided order of the letters or confirmation of the result. Generally frowned upon in puzzle construction, though occasionally a useful puzzle solving step if the order cannot be found, and there isn't a universally agreed-upon definition of what counts as "confirmation" enough to make an anagram not qualify.

Wheel of Fortune (WoF)

:   To guess answers while knowing, or having guesses for, only some of the letters and their positions. Named after the American game show.

# Miscellaneous

Arepo

:   One inelegant component of a construction that allows the whole thing to work. Named after the [Sator Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square).

[National Puzzlers' League](https://www.puzzlers.org/) (NPL)

:   An organization of puzzlers founded in 1883. Generally more focused on word play and word games than other kinds of puzzles, though certainly not exclusively. Publishes <i>The ENIGMA</i>, a monthly magazine, and hosts an annual convention whose name depends on where it's hosted. Most strongly associated with the puzzle type of the "flat".

Red herring

:   Any false path in a puzzle, e.g. an unintended message that can be extracted from the puzzle data or a coincidental pattern that isn't actually relevant to solving the puzzle. Some red herrings are surprising enough to become enshrined in puzzlehunt history, e.g. ["BE NOISY"](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2002/endgame/benoisy.html) from the 2002 Mystery Hunt. Putting intentional red herrings in puzzles is frowned upon because solvers will make their own.

    Some puzzles may use the literal phrase "red herring" or synonyms ("scarlet swimmer", etc.), or a picture of a red herring, in places where including some message or image is necessary to make the puzzle work, to explicitly indicate that there's no further meaning to that choice.

The Error That Cannot Be Named (TETCBN)

:   An error (or "error") in which the answer to a puzzle or clue literally appears in it. So called because naming the error as such and then fixing it would give away the answer to the puzzle or clue. Also from NPL.
